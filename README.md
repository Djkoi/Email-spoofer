Basic Principles
Email spoofing has been an issue since the earliest days of the SMTP protocol. The root cause of email spoofing is that SMTP does not require authentication between mail relays. An attacker can stand up or find an "Open Relay" (i.e. an SMTP server that can send from arbitrary domains), which is the default configuration for SMTP servers, and use that to send arbitrary emails from arbitrary email addresses.

FQDN Requirements
In an effort to combat spam, many SMTP servers now block any mail relay that does not have a Fully-qualified Domain Name (FQDN). An FQDN is a DNS A record that points to the relay's IP address. This can be either a domain purchased from a domain registrar, or by using a domain automatically associated with a virtual private server.

Email Protections
As email spoofing is a serious and widespread issue, over the years several protection mechanisms have been added to combat it. However, all of these protections are opt-in and require significant configuration. As such, as much as 98% of the internet is still vulnerable. For additional information, please see the Bishop Fox blog post on the subject.

To determine if a domain is vulnerable to email spoofing, Bishop Fox has created two tools:

A web interface that produces a report with analysis and recommendations
A command line utility that only performs analysis
Disclaimer
Only use this tool for education, research, or in the course of approved social engineering assessments. While email spoofing is a powerful tool in the social engineer's arsenal, it is also trivial to identify the server that sent any email. Furthermore, this tool makes no claims to bypass any products such as Barracuda or ForcePoint email protections suites. Please use responsibly.
